### Task 1: Implement ArangoDB CRUD Operations for Lessons Learned ⏳ In Progress

**Objective**: Create a focused module for managing lessons learned documents in ArangoDB.

**Requirements**:
1. Create a dedicated module for ArangoDB CRUD operations
2. Implement create, read, update, and delete functions for lessons_learned collection
3. Add validation for lesson document structure
4. Include error handling and logging
5. Create a simple CLI interface for managing lessons

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Create  with connection management functions
- [ ] Implement  for lessons-specific operations
- [ ] Add validation for lesson document structure
- [ ] Create CLI command in 
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and retries
- [ ] Add documentation in 
- [ ] Write basic tests for CRUD operations

**Technical Specifications**:
- Store connection parameters in environment variables (ARANGO_HOST, ARANGO_USER, ARANGO_PASSWORD, ARANGO_DB)
- Use the official Python-Arango driver
- Document schema should match the ArangoDB format with required _key and _id fields

- Existing lessons_learned.json in .claude/project_docs/

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Implement Improved Table Merger

Successfully implemented an improved table merger with three configurable strategies:
- Conservative: Only merges tables with high similarity
- Aggressive: Merges tables with more relaxed requirements
- None: Disables merging functionality

Key achievements:
- Created improved_table_merger.py with configurable strategies
- Integrated with table_extractor.py
- Added comprehensive tests
- Fixed project directory structure
- Documented implementation and API

All code is properly organized in src/pdf_extractor/ with tests in src/pdf_extractor/test/
and documentation in docs/.
