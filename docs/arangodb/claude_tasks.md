- [x] Implement main CLI structure in `/src/complexity/cli.py`
- [x] Add command groups for different functionality areas
- [x] Implement database connection utilities
- [x] Implement global callback for configuration
- [x] Add logging setup and error handling
- [x] Create help documentation with proper formatting
- [x] Add environment variable configuration
- [x] Create hybrid search command interface
- [x] Implement database operation commands (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Implement graph operation commands (add edge, delete edge, traverse)
- [x] Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations

## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Implement tag search command
- [ ] Implement keyword search command
- [ ] Create test cases for CLI commands
- [ ] Add examples to command help text

## Development Roadmap

### High Priority (First Phase) - Completed âœ…
- [x] Basic CLI structure with proper command groups
- [x] Core search functionality (hybrid, semantic, BM25)
- [x] Basic error handling and logging
- [x] Help documentation for commands

### Medium Priority (Current Phase)
- [x] Complete database operation commands
- [x] Add graph operation commands
- [ ] Implement additional search features (tag, keyword)
- [x] Add proper input validation

### Next Steps (Third Phase)
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
- [ ] Create sample workflows
- [ ] Add enhanced documentation with examples
- [ ] Add default configuration options

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Interactive mode for command execution
- [ ] Batch processing of operations
- [ ] Config file support for default parameters
- [ ] Output formatting options (table, JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Integration with web interface

## Reference Implementation
The existing CLI implementation at `/src/complexity/arangodb/cli.py` provides a good reference with:
- Command structure using Typer
- Search command implementations
- Database operation patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Result formatting utilities

## Notes
- The new CLI should maintain compatibility with the existing command structure
- Focus on consistent error handling and user feedback
- Ensure proper documentation for all commands
- Follow best practices for CLI design and implementation
